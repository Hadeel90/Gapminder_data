Visualization of one Gapminder data from Gapminder.org

The visualizations in these files display fertility tally, relating 1990, my date of birth, to 2018, the current year.  It's showing the distinction between the two years on two different map projections: cylindrical and polar. The final images will be on my website and Instagram (which can be found on my website.)

P.S. The maps are obtained from stock.adobe.com, so I can't upload them on Github to avoid copyright infringement, but the screenshots can give you an idea of the two map projections.
